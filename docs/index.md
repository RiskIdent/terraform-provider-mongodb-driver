## Schema

### Required

- `uri` (String, Sensitive) Connection URI, also known as the connection string.
Tells the provider how to reach MongoDB.

The implementation is based on the Go SDK.
For a full reference of connection URI options available for the Go SDK, see this page: <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/fundamentals/connection/>

### Optional

- `password` (String, Sensitive) Allows specifying the password for the connection. You must also set the `username` attribute when using this attribute.
- `username` (String) Allows specifying the username for the connection. Setting this will override any credentials used in the connection URI.
